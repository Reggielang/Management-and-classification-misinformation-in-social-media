Compare the emotional tone and aggression in English and Chinese tweet data.

I want to compare their tweet'emotion and aggression in recent months to see if there is any aggressive behavior , such as spreading rumors and denigrating people or countries.

By looking for some keywords, including China, USA, EU, South America, I found that there were a lot of rumors or conspiracy theories, or even offensive statements, such as the United States is moving towards World War III.
